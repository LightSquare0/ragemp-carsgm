# Invictum.mp - Racing gamemode for Rage Multiplayer (GTA V) - WIP

Basic racing gamemode with key features:
- Login system
- Basic admin system
- Race hosting
- Real time race participants positioning
- Race creator 
- React interfaces to help ease the interaction

# Race hosting
Everyone can host. The customisable parameters are: the track, the race mode (total race time, or number of laps) and the vehicles.   
Once hosted, the race will appear on the global race list and anyone can join.
